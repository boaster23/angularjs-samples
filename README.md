Angular Application Requirements

Used on 3 seperate single page applications with similar requirements. 
* People Profile Explorer
* Ask Someone Questions
* 

To allow users to browse a collection of items stored on a database and filter results based on user selections from 3 to 4 separate categories. Clicking on a thumbnail or truncated text, would hide the index page and replace it with a detail page for that item: app3.js
