Angular Application Requirements

Used for 3 different single page applications with similar requirements. 
* People profile explorer (HTML=people.cfm)
* Q & A explorer (HTML=questions.cfm)
* Employer profile explorer (HTML=employer.cfm)

The purpose of this application is to allow users to browse an index of items stored on a database and filter results on user selections from 3 to 4 separate categories. Clicking on a thumbnail or truncated text, would hide the index page and replace it with a detail page for that item.

Script file located at: js/app.js

Note: Coldfusion server side code has been removed, including the files delivering the JSON data.
