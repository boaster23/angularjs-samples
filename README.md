Angular Application Requirements

Used for 3 different single page applications with similar requirements. To allow users to browse a collection of items stored on a database and filter results based on user selections from 3 to 4 seperate categories. Clicking on a thumbnail or truncated text, would hide the index index page and replace it with a detail page for that item: app3.js
